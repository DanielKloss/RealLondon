His first was a laser shot from just inside the opponent's half, leaving the keeper grasping at thin air. The secondwas made by Howourth's ball from deep and Mantle's perfectly timed run to meet and loop a header over the keeper and into the far corner.\n\nThe mood was optimistic in the wake of the defeat - it was felt that they had the makings of a good team. Little did they know that they wouldn't beat their tally of 2 goals in a game for the rest of the season...",

Mantle put in a colossal display at the back while the midfield running of Josh HD and Thronton made it feel like Real London had 8 players on the pitch, not 6! When Mark Bridger's high press won the ball he fed Howourth who finished with a dink over the keeper.\n\nBut it would all end in heartbreak for The Londoners. The opposition chipped away and as the 12 legs of Real London tired they conceded two goals in the dying minutes of the game. Relegation was upon them but they went down fighting.",

It was Thornton's final game before his big money move away to Asian Super League and Real London recorded their biggest ever win.\n\n5 goals flattered the opposition as in reality it could have been far more, still 5 different goal scorers left Real fans happy. The first goal was a great piece of individual skill from Hedley-Dent gliding through the defense he placed his shot low and beyond the keeper but the second was arguably the pick of the bunch. Howourth and Hedley-Dent combined really well to split the defnse wide open and leave Bridger to tap in from close range. Roles were reversed for the third as Bridger turned provider for Howourth who flicked the ball inside the far post.\n\nTom Mantel secured the fourth with a long range effort and the rout was completed in the last minute of the game when a good McDowell save allowed Real to brake away down field ending with Kloss smashing in while one on one with the keeper.",

From then on the match was a stalemate, Bridger was running things for the whites in midfield while Gregory and Hedley-Dent were combining well at the back to keep the opposition out.\n\nThe final seconds of the game loomed when Gizzi launched a long throw into the box. Thomas Hau caused more havoc in the opposition penalty area which left Kloss free to cushion his header and clinch all three points. As it turned out, that would be Hau's final act as a Real London player before is move back to his boyhood club in west London.",

Hedley-Dent's endless running in midfeild ensured Real London totally dominated.\n\nThe only thing lacking was a goal. Gilt edged chances came and went and as frustration grew there was a feeling that they might concede a sucker punch at the other end. The team however showed 'top-top-super-quality character' and ensured that if they couldn't win the game they didn't lose the game.",

Real London went into half time on top and felt they could still snatch some points from the game. However, their concentration lapsed stright after the restart and they were behind again before they knew it.\n\nLate pressure including a shot from McDowell that fizzed the wrong side of the post couldn't prevent the loss. To add insult to injury, news broke after the game that Mantle's loan spell at the club would be ending as he was called back to his parent club.",
