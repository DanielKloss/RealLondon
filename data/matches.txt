Little did they know that they wouldn't beat their tally of 2 goals in a game for the rest of the season...",

A win would pull them off the bottom and give them a chance of survival, a loss would seal their relegation fate.\n\nIt was a performance to instil pride into the fans of the whites. Mantle put in a colossal display at the back while the midfield running of Josh HD and Thronton made it feel like Real London had 8 players on the pitch, not 6! When Mark Bridger's high press won the ball he fed Howourth who finished with a dink over the keeper.\n\nBut it would all end in heartbreak for The Londoners. The opposition chipped away and as the 12 legs of Real London tired they conceded two goals in the dying minutes of the game. Relegation was upon them but they went down fighting.",

Thornton and Howourth had seen lots of the ball in advanced areas and it was only a matter of time before they pulled one back.\n\n3 minutes later it was 0-4.\n\nJonny Dauncey restored some pride with a lobbed finish and Joe Walker made some important saves in goal.

It was Thornton's final game before his big money move away to Asian Super League and Real London recorded their biggest ever win.\n\n5 goals flattered the opposition as in reality it could have been far more, still 5 different goal scorers left Real fans happy. The first goal was a great piece of individual skill from Hedley-Dent gliding through the defense he placed his shot low and beyond the keeper but the second was arguably the pick of the bunch. Howourth and Hedley-Dent combined really well to split the defnse wide open and leave Bridger to tap in from close range. Roles were reversed for the third as Bridger turned provider for Howourth who flicked the ball inside the far post.\n\nTom Mantel secured the fourth with a long range effort and the rout was completed in the last minute of the game when a good McDowell save allowed Real to brake away down field ending with Kloss smashing in while one on one with the keeper.",

From then on the match was a stalemate, Bridger was running things for the whites in midfield while Gregory and Hedley-Dent were combining well at the back to keep the opposition out.\n\nThe final seconds of the game loomed when Gizzi launched a long throw into the box. Thomas Hau caused more havoc in the opposition penalty area which left Kloss free to cushion his header and clinch all three points. As it turned out, that would be Hau's final act as a Real London player before is move back to his boyhood club in west London.",

Hedley-Dent's endless running in midfeild ensured Real London totally dominated.\n\nThe only thing lacking was a goal.

The opposition team were in stark contrast to the scouting report and soon put together a good passing move resulting in the first goal.\n\nAs Real London grew into the game Howourth and Bridger had sightings of goal and their pressure paid off when the ball broke to Gluckstien who finished enfatically into the top corner. Real London went into half time on top and felt they could still snatch some points from the game. However, their concentration lapsed stright after the restart and they were behind again before they knew it.\n\nLate pressure including a shot from McDowell that fizzed the wrong side of the post couldn't prevent the loss. To add insult to injury, news broke after the game that Mantle's loan spell at the club would be ending as he was called back to his parent club.",

Real London defended stoutly and turned to debutant Jukes to bail them out of trouble on more than one occassion.\n\nIn the heat and the desperation to win, the fluid football that Real London fans are used to was lacking.

Defensive mixups and stray passes meant that they didn't look like getting anything from the game.\n\n But football is a funny old game and after two suberb flowing passing moves the boys in white found themselves back in the game - Kuran finished the first enfatically and McDowell swept home just seconds later. Optimism flowed through the team and there was a real feeling that they could snatch a draw from the jaws of defeat.

Hurst turned in a cross field Pass from Jukes and as the first half wore on the only thing in doubt was just how many the boys in white could score. Jackson had the opposition striker in his pocket, Gizzi and Jukes were storming up the wings, Hedley-Dent was bossing the middle of the park and Bridger was holding the ball up brilliantly. A clever Hurst freekick made it two early in the second half and Real London were cruising.\n\nFootball is a game that can be turned on tiny moments and that was the case today - a tiny lapse in concentration saw the opposition score their first chance of the game and heads dropped. They'd been here before and knew what was coming. The second and third goals followed quickly and the collapse was complete.\n\nEven a goal down Real London were still by far the better team and squandered three glorious late chances to put themselves back in the game. Their slide down the table continues and a title challenge has now turned into a relegation battle.",
